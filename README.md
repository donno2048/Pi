# Pi
This are ten algorithms in python to calculate pi without any imports.

Mathematically they all converges to pi but python has limited accuracy causes each algorithm to be slightly inaccurate.

I ran each one to the maximum accuracy it can get (if the time isn't huge) and printed the output

To run it just run _main.py_
